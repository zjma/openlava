openlava docker integration
---------------------------

1) Introduction

Docker is a virtualization technology built on linux containers
and cgroups. It provides prebuilt images of operating systems
and users can execute applications inside them a running image
is called container. More details about docker can be found here:
www.docker.com.
In order to work with the integration is enough to understand
images and containers.

2) Supported version

The openlava docker integration is built using openlava 3.0
and docker client/server version 1.3.2.

3) Architecture

The integration allows users to submit applications as openlava jobs
that will transparently run in a container. The openlava job control
commands bstop/bresume/bkill will operate on running containers.
The integration is done through an openlava queue based job starter
which runs the 'docker run image:tag' command appending the user
specified command, so the user does not have to explicitly specify
the image name. The starter adds a container name which is a fundamental
parameter for the launch specification, the name is the LSB_JOBID.
In this way both openlava and docker refer to the container using the
openlava jobid, all control operation of the openlava and docker side
are done using the jobid.
The image:tag that are needed for docker to identify which image has
to be used to run the container has to be specified in the submission
environment as LSB_DOCKER_IMAGE. e.g in bash shell:

export  LSB_DOCKER_IMAGE=centos:app

This variable has to be set either by the user or by the tool administrator.

4) Configuration

4.1) openlava base

In the lsf.shared define a new boolean resources called docker and add this
resource to docker hosts in lsf.cluster.<your cluster name>

Begin Resource
RESOURCENAME  TYPE    INTERVAL INCREASING  DESCRIPTION        # Keywords
   docker     Boolean ()       ()          (docker server)
   ...
End Resource

Begin   Host
HOSTNAME       model    type  server r1m  RESOURCES
prometeo      IntelI5   linux   1    3.5  (cs docker)
End     Host

4.2) openlava batch

Select a queue or queues where to run the dockerized application and
configure the job starter and the job control actions.

Begin Queue
QUEUE_NAME   = normal
PRIORITY     = 60
 ...
JOB_STARTER = /usr/local/openlava3/bin/docker_starter "%USRCMD"
JOB_CONTROLS = SUSPEND[/usr/local/openlava3/bin/docker_stop] \
RESUME[/usr/local/openlava3/bin/docker_resume] \
TERMINATE[/usr/local/openlava3/bin/docker_terminate]
 ...
End Queue

The files docker_starter, docker_stop, docker_resume and docker_terminate are
int the openlava source tree in the examples/docker directory. docker_starter
is a C program that needs to be compiled while the other are just scripts.
Copy them to your binary distribution.

4.3) Reconfig and verify that openlava is configured correctly.

$ lshosts
HOST_NAME      type    model  cpuf ncpus maxmem maxswp server RESOURCES
prometeo      linux  IntelI5 100.0     4 31807M 63998M    Yes (cs docker)
$ bqueues -l normal

QUEUE: normal
  -- For docker jobs.
 ...
JOB_STARTER:  /home/david/openlava/master/examples/docker/docker_starter "%USRCMD"

JOB_CONTROLS:
    SUSPEND:      [/home/david/openlava/master/examples/docker/docker_stop]
    RESUME:       [/home/david/openlava/master/examples/docker/docker_resume]
    TERMINATE:    [/home/david/openlava/master/examples/docker/docker_terminate]

5) Example

5.1) Docker images

We have built a docker image called centos:app. This is CentOS 7 based image
with gcc and our own application called hello built in.

 $ docker images centos
REPOSITORY  TAG    IMAGE ID       CREATED       VIRTUAL SIZE
centos      app    62641afe6cf4  4 days ago       603.4 MB

We want to run the application hello inside the image centos:app.

5.2) Set the LSB_DOCKER_IMAGE in the environment, alternatively the
admin of the tool will set it in the execution script.

export LSB_DOCKER_IMAGE=centos:app

5.3) Submit a batch job.

$ bsub /usr/local/app/hello
Job <929> is submitted to default queue <normal>.

Both openlava and docker show the job and the container running using
the same jobid.

 $ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED
23bc708ef1f4        centos:app    "/usr/local/app/hell"   3 minutes ago
STATUS                  PORTS               NAMES
Up 14 seconds                           929

$bjobs
JOBID   USER    STAT  QUEUE      FROM_HOST   EXEC_HOST   JOB_NAME   SUBMIT_TIME
929     david   RUN   normal     prometeo    prometeo    sleep 3600 Feb 24 16:43

The docker output is edited for formatting reasons.

We can stop and resume the container:

$ bstop 929
Job <929> is being stopped

docker ps output will show (Paused)

$ bresume 929
Job <929> is being resumed

This will clear the (Paused) flag in docker ps.

Finally we terminate the container.

Using 'docker -pa' we can see out job container was terminated

CONTAINER ID        IMAGE          COMMAND                   CREATED
23bc708ef1f4        centos:app    "/usr/local/app/hell"      4 minutes ago
STATUS                        PORTS               NAMES
Exited (-1) 9 seconds ago                         929
